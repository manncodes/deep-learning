    "With transfer learning, we take a pre-trained model and retrain it on a task that has some overlap with the original training task. A good analogy for this is an artist who is skilled in one medium, such as painting, who wants to learn to practice in another medium, such as charcoal drawing. We can imagine that the skills they learned while painting would be very valuable in learning how to draw with charcoal. \n",
